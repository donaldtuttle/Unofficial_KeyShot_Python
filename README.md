## Introduction

KeyShot by Luxion is a leading real-time 3D rendering and animation software. The KeyShot Python API allows for scripting and automation of various KeyShot functionalities, enhancing productivity and enabling advanced customizations. This repository documents the `lux` and `luxmath` libraries, provides insights into running KeyShot in headless mode, and shares useful script examples.

## lux Library Documentation

The `lux` library is KeyShot's primary interface for scripting, offering functions to control scenes, materials, cameras, rendering, and more. [Explore the lux library documentation.](lux/KeyShot_Lux_API.md)

## luxmath Library Documentation

For mathematical operations, the `luxmath` library provides Vector and Matrix classes, essential for transformations and other calculations in scripts. [Learn more about luxmath.](luxmath/KeyShot_LuxMath_API.md)

## Headless Mode Documentation

Running KeyShot in headless mode enables automation and integration into pipelines without the GUI. This section covers the essentials for both `lux` and `luxmath` libraries in headless operation.

### lux Headless

Documentation specific to using the `lux` library without the KeyShot interface. [Dive into lux headless mode.](lux_headless/KeyShot_Headless_Lux_API.md)

### luxmath Headless

Similar to the `luxmath` library, but focused on headless applications. [Discover luxmath in headless mode.](luxmath_headless/KeyShot_Headless_LuxMath_API.md)

## Example Scripts

A collection of scripts demonstrating the practical application of KeyShot's Python API for common tasks and advanced customizations. [Browse example scripts.](scripts/README.md)
